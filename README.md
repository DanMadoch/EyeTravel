# EyeTravel

EyeTravel is a navigation app using HERE Technology's SDKs, specifically designed for the visually impaired with large buttons and contrasting colors.

## Installation

Clone the repository on your computer and then drag the files into a project. 

## Features

Currently there the only working buttons are the Directions and Time buttons, though I do plan to try and get the other pages working as a small side project of my own.

I might add/remove some of the buttons as I feel some are useless like a magnifier button as most phones already have magnifiers under their accessibility options and those who need that almost definitely already know about it.

## Note

If the app does not prompt you to access your location, please turn on the permissions for the app on the phone itself. That can usually be found in a phone under Settings>Permissions or Settings>Location and finding the app and giving it permissions. 

Also this app is currently android only and I've tested it on android studio using a Pixel 2 API 28 emulator, and my Samsung Galaxy S9 which is fully updated. The program itself requires at a minimum an API level 21.
